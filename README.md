To deduct the motion of the human and making the speaker in active/inactive mode. When the speaker is active then the speaker should welcome the user by some song. When the speaker is in active mode user can use the speaker via interface which is an application. This application should contain functionalities such as remainder, playing the song that is selected by the user, alarm, greeting based on the timestamp.

Bread Board:  This is used in order to avoid clash that occurs when two different devices want to connect to the same pin of Arduino.

Male Connectors:  These are the type of jumpers which used for connection purpose from sensors to the Arduino.

Female Connectors:  These are the jumpers which have hole in one of its 2 sides where is  capable of directly connecting to the pin of the sensor without the help of bread board for that respective end.

Ultrasonic Sensor:  This is a type of sensor which deducts the motion of the objects, humans. Here the range for the sensor is given in the code, if the value given by the sensor is within that range that is if the human or the object is within the specified range then the signal is sent to the speaker to sound Good Morning.

Bluetooth Module:  This module helps to connect the mobile app to the Bluetooth which is interconnected to the speaker to do tasks that plays song, reminding event, Alarm, greetings. All the settings and controlling these tasks are done via the app which is linked to the Bluetooth.

Speaker:  The device which gives the sound when the instruction comes. All instructions will be coming from the 3rd pin from the Arduino board.

Memory Card Module:  This module will require SD card where the songs are present. This is connected to the Arduino board for the power supply. The song which should be played will be selected with the help of app, then the Bluetooth module which is connected to the app will forward the instruction to the Arduino and from there the instruction is passed to the speaker via Arduino to sound the song.

RTC Module:  This is user to give the time knowledge to the Arduino.
